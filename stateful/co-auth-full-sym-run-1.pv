SETUP:

-- A stateful model of Co-authentication using StatVerif features
-- Symmetric key cryptography is used.
-- Attackers don't have any keys.
-- Active attackers

VERIFICATION RESULT SUMMARY:

-- Attackers cannot get the secret session key and transmitted acknowledgment message
-- Authentication of A to R holds 
-- Authentication of R to A holds
