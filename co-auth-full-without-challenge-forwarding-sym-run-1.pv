SETUP:

-- Symmetric key cryptography is used.
-- Attackers don't have any keys.
-- Active attackers


VERIFICATION RESULT SUMMARY:

-- Attackers cannot get secret session key and transmitted acknowledgment message
-- Authentication of A to R holds 
-- Authentication of R to A cannot be proved by ProVerif.  The model checker shows an untrue attack trace.  
    An attacker sits in the middle of the communication and receives access request message.  
    Then the attacker obtains a collaboration response message by listening to the communication 
    between Collaborator and Authenticator.  Finally, the attacker sends access request and collaboration
    response to Authenticator and receive the encrypted session key.  However, such attack does not allow an
    attacker to obtain any secret information.  Also an attacker cannot masquerade as a legitimate actor or
    initiate an authentication and collaboration.
